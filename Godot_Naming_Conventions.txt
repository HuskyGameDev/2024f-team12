The naming conventions/etiquette for our Godot project is as follows:

All scenes (and main nodes) will be named in camel caps
	i.e. LevelOne

All other nodes will be named with lowercase and underscores
	i.e. main_character

For storing/folders, all Scenes should have their own folder in their respective designation
	i.e. >Scenes>Characters>Player
	This folder will contain the scene itself as well as any scripts used
